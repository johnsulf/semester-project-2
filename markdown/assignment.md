# Auction Website Frontend

## Goal

The goal of this project is to utilize the skills learned over the past three semesters to create an auction website. The website will allow users to add items for auction and bid on items listed by other users.

## Brief

An auction site is looking to launch a platform where users can:

- Add items to be bid on.
- Bid on items other users have put up for auction.

### User Permissions

- New users are given 1000 credits upon registration.
- Users earn credits by selling items and use credits to purchase items.
- Non-registered users can search through the listings.
- Only registered users can make bids on listings.

### Requirements

This project covers only the front-end application for the existing API that manages all backend functionality.

## API
